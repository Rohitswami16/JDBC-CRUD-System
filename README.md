### JDBC-CRUD-System
The JDBC-CRUD-System is a Java-based desktop application that demonstrates the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). This system is designed for managing employee records and includes a user-friendly GUI built with JFrame. The application allows users to perform operations such as viewing, adding, updating, and removing employee records.

 ## Key Features
Home Page: The central interface with five buttons to navigate through the system:
View Employees: Displays all employee records, including employee ID, name, salary, email, phone number, and address.
View by ID: Allows the user to search for and display a specific employee's details by their ID.
Add Employee: Allows adding new employee records into the system with validation to prevent duplicate entries.
Remove Employee: Removes an employee record using their ID.
Update Employee: Updates details (such as name, salary, email, etc.) of an existing employee.
Exception Handling: Provides meaningful messages when operations fail (e.g., "No such employee present," "Duplicate entry not allowed").
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java
Database: MySQL (or any JDBC-compatible database)
GUI Framework: JFrame
JDBC: For database connectivity and operations

Database Schema
To set up the database, execute the following SQL script:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE EmployeeDB;
USE EmployeeDB;

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    position VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    address VARCHAR(200)
);
How to Run the Project
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Rohitswami16/JDBC-CRUD-System.git
Set Up the Database:

Install MySQL or any JDBC-compatible database.
Execute the SQL script in db-scripts/schema.sql to create the necessary database and table.
Configure Database Connection:

Edit the application.properties file in the resources folder to specify your database credentials:
properties
Copy code
db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/EmployeeDB
db.user=root
db.password=password
Run the Application:

Open the project in your IDE (e.g., Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA).
Add the JDBC driver (mysql-connector-java.jar) to the classpath.
Run the Main.java file to start the application.
Functionality of Buttons
View Employees:

Displays all employees in the database with their details such as ID, name, salary, email, phone, and address.
Add Employee:

Prompts the user to enter employee details (name, position, salary, email, phone, address).
If a duplicate entry (e.g., same name or email) is detected, it will display a message: "Duplicate entry not allowed."
View by ID:

Prompts the user to enter an employee's ID. If the employee exists, their details are displayed; otherwise, a message "Employee doesn't exist" is shown.
Remove Employee:

Prompts the user to enter an employee's ID. The corresponding record is removed from the database. If the employee doesn't exist, a message "Employee not found" is shown.
Update Employee:

Prompts the user to enter an employee's ID. If the employee exists, their details are displayed. The user can then update fields like name, position, salary, email, phone, and address.

Future Enhancements
Add role-based authentication for secure access.
Implement advanced search and filtering options.
Enhance the GUI with modern UI frameworks like JavaFX.
Support for exporting employee data to Excel or PDF.
