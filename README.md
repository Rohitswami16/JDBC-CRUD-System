# JDBC-CRUD-System

## üìú Project Overview

The **JDBC-CRUD-System** is a Java-based desktop application that demonstrates the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using **JDBC** (Java Database Connectivity). This system is designed for managing employee records and includes a user-friendly **GUI** built with **JFrame**. The application allows users to perform operations such as viewing, adding, updating, and removing employee records.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Home Page
- The central interface with five buttons to navigate through the system:
  - **View Employees**: Displays all employee records, including employee ID, name, salary, email, phone number, and address.
  - **View by ID**: Allows the user to search for and display a specific employee's details by their ID.
  - **Add Employee**: Allows adding new employee records into the system with validation to prevent duplicate entries.
  - **Remove Employee**: Removes an employee record using their ID.
  - **Update Employee**: Updates details (such as name, salary, email, etc.) of an existing employee.
  
### Exception Handling
- Provides meaningful messages when operations fail (e.g., "No such employee present," "Duplicate entry not allowed").
